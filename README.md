# Yishi-Logo-Animation

*A tiny logotype design*

The file `logo_sketch/finale.svg` is my first logotype design finished in one day, and most of the temporary files are stored in the folder. I edit the svg file without any professional software, but only use online `SVG Editor` as assistance, so it's really a tough work. `logo_animation.html` is a short animation of the logo, taking me another day to finish.

This project has helped me learn more features of awesome svg.
